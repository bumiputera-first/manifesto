								The possibility of this kind of political party
								ever rising to power is near zero. While some of the policies can be insightful,
								here are some reasons why it wouldn't work:
							</p>

							<ol class="mt-6">
								<li>
									Forceful seizure of the means of production will always result in it not being
									returned to the people which anarchists are unfortunately right about.
									Even if everyone in Bumiputera First wholeheartedly wants to redistribute these
									resources, the powers behind the enforcement, other states and political agents,
									etc. will first agree to seize everything, then simply choose not to cooperate
									with us, keeping it to themselves and their cronies.

									Because such a policy requires an unrealistic and overwhelming amount of force
									and power to deploy and maintain, the political climate will become militaristic.
									Even without taking external influences into account, established political
									parties and known figures within the country have closer ties to the police
									and military.

									It is almost guaranteed that in the fictitious or miraculous event
									of Bumiputera First ever becoming government and can magically set its policies
									into motion, it would simply become a puppet of these forces; a coup will happen
									so naturally that one would be brainless not to see it coming.
									All of our efforts will only benefit a select few groups, and we will be
									discarded as empty scapegoat husks locked up in	jail to rot after we've helped
									them inculcate a generation of extremists to better suit their whims.
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									The concept of limiting riches and individual assets one can have is very
									anti-capitalistic even though it is a capitalist policy. In other words,
									even if this is supposed to benefit the majority of citizens, this type of
									taxation is extremely oppressive to rich citizens and foreign corporations
									who rely on stealing the labor of the middle class, which will discourage
									anyone from investing in Malaysia ever again and can suppress a lot of
									innovation for some time. Many corporations, overseas or not, will pull out
									immediately knowing that their profits will be hard limited
									(they won't be seized in time and a lot of resources and money will be siphoned
									out of Malaysia long before the party comes into power). Banks will be wiped out
									from the country and people won't even know how to function in such a sudden,
									drastically changed society let alone the current one. Malaysia will be in a
									state of turmoil for a very long time with almost no hope of recovery.
									As a result, basic income implementation and access to necessities will be
									difficult with all the hyperinflation going on. Anything Bumiputera First
									suggests, if still in power, will be met with a lot of retaliation.
									This issue compounds, and we will likely be unable to secure enough production
									facilities to feed everyone, leading to famine. Therefore, awareness and
									change must be introduced very slowly and gradually not only to Malaysians,
									but to the world about Malaysia, nothing like the hostile takeover that is
									the mission of this party. Even so, this type of policy can only succeed if
									Malaysia is already self-sufficient, highly automated/technologically advanced,
									highly educated and highly aware of what late-stage capitalism entails.
									This is not the case for even the most advanced and developed societies
									on this planet.
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									Institutionalizing a certain race as above all others has extremely dire
									consequences. It is a precursor to something more heinous. Terrible crimes
									can be perpetrated against certain races and nobody will bat an eye. It has
									already happened and is still happening in our current society, so I shouldn't
									have to explain this. I believe that a party as racist as Bumiputera First
									cannot even be registered under the Registrar of Societies; in turn,
									its members may even be arrested for hate speech and disturbing racial unity
									even if it is clearly a joke. As if the public wouldn't be disapproving enough,
									other existing political parties would want to crush this new one out of
									existence before it has any chance to grow, regardless of its values.
								</li>
							</ol>

							<p class="is-size-5 mt-6">
								There are a lot more other systemic issues and we would have to deal with religion
								sooner or later, but thank goodness we won't even be able to reach that point.
								If after reading this, you still want this party to exist for shits and giggles
								or as a social/political science experiment despite its dangers, we could attempt
								to register this party if a significant amount of brilliant minds apply
								<em>(just say "Hormat Melayu!" and acknowledge that this is a joke)</em>,
								just be prepared to be cancelled by everyone immediately.
